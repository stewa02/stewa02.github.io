                <h1>Philosophy</h1>
                <p>
                    My philosophy when it comes to vim and plugins has always
                    been, that plugins have to be small, not require special 
                    compilation of the editor (for example python support) to be
                    portable between my different systems and platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because many plugins were to big and complicated or required
                    a lot of configuration to work like I want them to and
                    because I'm interested in Vimscript and the editor itself I
                    started to work on some plugins specifically for my personal
                    use. Some of which I published/will publish on GitHub.
                </p>
